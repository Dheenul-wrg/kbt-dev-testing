- Do not include PII or secrets in logs. Redact identifiers when necessary.
- Gate verbose logs to development only (e.g., Prisma `query` logs, Apollo error link details).
- In production, prefer structured, minimal logs and generic error messages for 500s.
- Avoid logging full request/response bodies; log correlation IDs and high-level context instead.
