- Unit tests: Vitest (requires approval to add). Co-locate tests or use `src/__tests__`.
- E2E tests: Playwright (requires approval to add). Keep flows minimal and stable.
- Mock external services (GraphQL/HTTP) in unit tests; use MSW for client tests if needed.
- Keep tests fast and deterministic; avoid real DB in unit testsâ€”mock Prisma.
