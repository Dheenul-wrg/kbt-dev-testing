- Do not modify rule files, `tsconfig.json`, `eslint.config.mjs`, or `prisma/schema.prisma` without explicit instruction.
- When introducing env usage, update `README.md` and `.env.example` accordingly.
- Prefer updating existing modules over creating duplicates.
- After DB changes, include required Prisma commands in the PR description.
- Avoid adding dependencies unless necessary and justified.
- Do not introduce or broaden usage of `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` env vars unless strictly needed; prefer server-only envs.
- Avoid adding heavy client-side state libraries when RSC can handle data fetching/state.
