- ESLint extends `next/core-web-vitals` and `next/typescript`; Prettier violations are errors.
- Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format` locally; fix before committing.
- TypeScript is strict; avoid `any` and unsafe casts. Use explicit return types on exports.
- Use the `@/*` alias for imports from `src`.
- Keep functions small; prefer early returns and clear guard clauses.
