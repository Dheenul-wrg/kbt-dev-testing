- Use Tailwind utility-first classes for layout/spacing/typography.
- PostCSS uses `@tailwindcss/postcss`; avoid custom plugins unless required.
- Keep className strings readable; factor repeated patterns into components.
- Prefer semantic HTML and accessible variants over arbitrary CSS.
- Avoid large custom CSS files; co-locate minimal CSS only when necessary.
