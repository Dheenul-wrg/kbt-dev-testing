- Use Conventional Commits (type(scope): subject). Examples: `feat(auth): add login route`, `fix(prisma): correct relation`.
- `chore(release):` is reserved for automated releases.
- Versioning and changelogs are handled by semantic-release. Do not manually bump versions.
- Keep PR titles aligned with commit conventions.
